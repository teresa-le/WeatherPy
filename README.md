# World Weather Analysis 

## Purpose 

The purpose of this project is to use Python, OpenWeatherMap's APIs and Geoapify's APIs to allow PlanMyTrip's app users to do the following: 
* Find their ideal cities to vacation in based on their weather preferences,
* suggest the nearest hotels in those cities to help users find accommodations and make their trip a reality,
* and help users develop a travel itinerary and travel route for a trip between four cities.
